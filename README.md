### Reflections and Comments

1. How did this go, overall?

- So poorly. I thought I was good to go when I got my HTML structure down, but as I was doing my CSS, my HTML was too complicated for me to keep up so I had to go back and redo my HTML. I created at least a decent looking structure like everything is in the vicinity of where they're suppose to go, but I need to keep playing around in CSS.

2. What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

- I understand now the whole thing about not immediately starting out your code and think about the wireframe of it. I did not do that because the time constraint of two hours scared me so I started immediately, but what took the most time was actually me going back to fix mistakes I made because I didn't clearly think it through.

3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

- It took me 2 ish hours. But I will go back later to play around in CSS.

- 1. How did this go, overall?

- I did not see that the index.html was already provided and wrote my own html. But I redid this assignment with the html provided and it went smoother. I felt like I could get more of the CSS onto the page.
